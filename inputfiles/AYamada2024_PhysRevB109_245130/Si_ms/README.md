- Version of SALMON
  -SALMON v.2.0.1.

- System
  - Si crystalline solid surface

- Purpose
  - For calculating the absorbance, transmittance, and reflectance (Fig.6(a) in Ref [1])

- Other information
  - * Symmetry option is used using input file of "sym.dat". "sym.dat" is prepared by utility program at (SALMON code)/utility/sym/.
  - * psp8 pseudopotential from abinit web-site is used.
  - * After the ground state calculation (in "gs" directory), calculate Maxwell-TDDFT. 
  - * Calculation time was 6 hours by Fugaku computer 720 nodes.
